1. add photoresistors sampling
2. redesign photoresistors array
3. TODO: send data
4. TODO: test
5. TODO: estimate possibility and traffic

04/28
1. add audio recording, but the microphone didn't work
2. add sd card
3. Teensy audio lib design tool
4. the recorded file in the teensy is raw, converting to wav
5. resolve adc0 conflict by using adc1
6. TODO: design external filter circuit

05/03
1. add sending photoresistors data via bluetooth
2. slightly change logic of updateReadings() for photoresistors
3. input the wav file to matlab, comb filter: remove angular freq at 0, pi/2, pi, better but weaker noise at all freq domain
4. TODO: bluetooth test
5. TODO: avoid noise, extract frequency, maybe need a comparator based on amplitude
6. tested photoresistors, basic range: 10k ~ 1M. 100k resistor as R_ref
